			<h3>2. Setup a local environment. Only static hosting is relevant so you can use any framework you like (the project comes with a node express server).</h3>
			<h3>3. Play around, draw some shapes.</h3>
			<h3>4. Play break-golf twice: make together some change to the code, then compete to find the change's effect(s).</h3>
			<h3>5. Find the bug (more accurately, the inconsistent behaviour). Fix it.</h3>
			<h3>6. Add a button for drawing triangles.</h3>
			<h3>7. When picking points (for all shapes), make markers to signal previously picked points. These markers should disappear when the shape is drawn.</h3>
			<h3>8. Add a button allowing the user to pick a color for the shapes.</h3>
			<h3>9. Enjoy some well-earned doodling.</h3>
			<h3>10. Understand how <code>handle_drawing</code> works.</h3>
